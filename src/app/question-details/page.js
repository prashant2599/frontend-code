                  For many, the change in seasons is a good time to do a deep
                  clean in their home, but how many of you have thought to go
                  through your medicine cabinets or storage bins and take
                  inventory of what medication you have in your home? You may be
                  surprised to find that you have expired medication that you

                  of that unused and expired medication? forgotten about or
                  unused medication that isn’t a part of your current medication
                  regimen. So, what do you do with
