          <h1>Business Systems Manager</h1>

          <h2>Our Mission</h2>

          <p>
            Healthcare should work for patients, but it doesn’t. In their time
            of need, they call down outdated insurance directories. Then wait on
            hold. Then wait weeks for the privilege of a visit. Then wait in a
            room solely designed for waiting. Then wait for a surprise bill. In
            any other consumer industry, the companies delivering such a poor
            customer experience would not survive. But in healthcare, patients
            lack market power. Which means they are expected to accept the
            unacceptable. Medflick's mission is to give power to the patient. To
            do that, we’ve built the leading healthcare marketplace that makes
            it easy to find and book in-person or virtual care in all 50 states,
            across +200 specialties and +12k insurance plans. By giving patients
            the ability to see and choose, we give them power. In doing so, we
            can make healthcare work like every other consumer sector, where
            businesses compete for customers, not the other way around. In time,
            this will drive quality up and prices down. We’re 15 years old and
            the leader in our space, but we are still just getting started. If
            you like solving important, complex problems alongside deeply
            thoughtful, driven, and collaborative teammates, read on.
          </p>

          <h2> Your impact on our mission: </h2>
          <p>
            You will lead a team of business system analysts to ensure we keep

            the breadth of Salesforce integration across Medflick, you will

            are seamlessly prioritizing and planning around the highest impact
            initiatives. You will help Commercial teams unlock the full
            potential of our business systems to drive growth.
